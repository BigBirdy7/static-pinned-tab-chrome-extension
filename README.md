# Static Pinned Tabs

I liked the pinned tabs feature in Chrome, because it allows me to keep certain pages, such as
Pandora and a Jira dashboard, open all the time, without taking up much space. The only problem is
I often navigate away from these pages unintentionally.

This extension keeps a pinned tab pinned to a page.

To install the extension, go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions), check the "developer
mode" box, select "Load unpacked extension...", and point to this directory. That's it!
